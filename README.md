# Summary

This website provides user with dynamic filter capability. However if a user need to see comments between a given date range it is impossible.
For a better user experience sites needs to be responsive. There it is highly recommended to update the code to consider mobile friendliness.
To improve the layout and save space it is better if we can show the Filter search box horizontally in a single line. this way we can give
the data table to hold the whole page and the filter row will be responsive to mobile view. The image below show how the search box make the page
longer on mobile view.
